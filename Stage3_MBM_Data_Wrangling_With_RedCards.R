######
## NOTE: there are DIFFERENT GAMES under the SAME GAME_ID!!!
## E.g. 252451 shows up as both: "Cologne FC vs someone" and "Hertha vs VfL Wolfsburg"
## => THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE ONLY CASE, but it SHOULD BE PRUDENT TO CREATE OUR OWN ID VARIABLE based on:
##    gameId, gamedDate, HomeTeam, AwayTeam


## SOME STUFF SEEMS OUT OF ORDER:
##      - Either the homeScore, awayScore  isn't always sequentially increasing
##      - Or something is going on with the minutes
##
##  CHECK: 252731 2008-09-20 Bayern Munich  vs Werder
##
## ISSUE: if there's a score on min 45+ on the first half, then it doesn't change for minutes that are equal to or lower in the 2nd half
##        FIX: Need to find all the moments where there's lower scores for later observations, and set them to the previous, higher, score


## There are BAD ENTRY issues with detecting PARENTHESIZED TEXT STUFF:
##    * Some are due to poor recording practice (not standardized.. so the parentheses aren't reserved solely for marking the teams)
##    * Others due to bad string matching (the team mentioned in commentary gets matched to wrong team in the ESPN header)
